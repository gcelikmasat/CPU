# CPU
Goal of this project is to design and implement a processor.

Firstly the instruction set architecture(ISA) was designed as efficiently as possible.

Then the java code that takes instructions and gives the corresponding hexadecimal outputs was implemented (Project.java).
Lastly the CPU is designed using AnyLogic.
CPU contains contains components like RegisterFile, ALU, Control Unit and Instruction Memory.
Resulting CPU model can perform all the operations from the ISA.
